# The Bouldering Project

The objective of this game is to push boulders into holes. You win when
every hole is filled. Click or tap on a square to move to it. If it is
reachable, your tractor will automatically move to it. Click on a boulder
you are next to to move it. If you get stuck, click reset to start over.
